## Basic usage

**DZSlides** is a **one-file** HTML template to build slides in HTML5 and CSS3.

[template.html](/paulrouget/dzslides/blob/master/template.html) is the only file you need. Edit the file, add your content, change the style, and you're done. To see the slides in action, just load
the file in your browser.

## Features

* Slides can include any HTML5 content (text, image, video, iframes, â€¦);
* Slides transitions are animated with CSS3 (sliding by default);
* Resolution independent (slides are scaled according to the size of the browser. The virtual dimension is 800x600);
* Fullscreen presentation (HTML5 FullScreen API supported) - press `f` to go fullscreen;
* Incremental content;
* Mobile Friendly (supports touch events).

## Shells

The features of DZSlides are intentionally limited to keep the template light
and simple to understand. *Shells* are extensions that bring new features
to your slides. Here, you'll find 2 shells:

* `shells/embedder.html` to embed a presentation in a web page
* `shells/onstage.html` to show your slides with a control panel

To use them, just load the file in your browser, and follow the instructions.

## Specifications

When you press the `left` and `right` keys, you go forward and go back in your slides.
But the slides can also respond to external messages. Messages can be sent through [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage).
So another web page can control the slides.

### Protocol

A `cursor` is a string of this form: `3.5`. The first number represent the current slide index. The second number represent the current sub-item index.

Parameters must be escaped.

***

Messages a DZSlides page can receive:

* `REGISTER` register the source of the message as a target to notify for any events;
* `FORWARD` move forward in the slides;
* `BACK` move back in the slides;
* `START` move to the first slide;
* `END` move to the last slide;
* `SET_CURSOR cursor` jump to the cursor;
* `GET_CURSOR` notify the source of the message of the current cursor;
* `TOGGLE_CONTENT` toggle the current slide content;
* `GET_NOTES cursor` notify the source of the message of the current notes content.

Messages a DZSlides page can send:

* `CURSOR cursor` sent to one target as a response to `GET_CURSOR`, and sent to all the registered target when updated;
* `REGISTERED slides_title slides_count` sent to one target as a response to `REGISTER`;
* `NOTES html_content` sent to one target as a response to `GET_NOTES`.

### Hash parameters

* `url&para1=va1`

Parameters a DZSlides page can have:

* `autoplay` (integer, values : `0`/`1`, default : `1`) sets whether multimedia contents (audio, video) should be played automatically.
