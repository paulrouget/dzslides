Yo,

    DZSlides is a HTML template to build slides in HTML5 and CSS3.
    'template.html' is the only file you need.
    Shells are extensions. You don't need them for a basic usage.
    For a complete presentation, see: http://paulrouget.com/dzslides.

    See 'examples/readme/slides.html' to start.

    The project contains two shells to handle your slides :

    * 'shells/controls.html'
    * 'shells/master.html'

    To use 'shells/controls.html', you need to put slides url after 
    controls.html page url. Example :

    http://localhost/dzslides/shells/controls.html#../examples/tmnt/slides.html

    
    To use 'shells/master.html' you need to set your slides url in URL variable.
    
    Example : open 'master.html' file and change this line :

    <script> var URL = "../examples/tmnt/slides.html"; </script>
