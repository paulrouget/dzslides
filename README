Yo,

    DZSlides is a HTML template to build slides in HTML5 and CSS3.
    'template.html' is the only file you need.
    Shells are extensions. You don't need them for a basic usage.

    The project contains two shells to handle your slides :

    * 'shells/embedder.html' to embed a presentation in a web page
    * 'shells/onstage.html' to show your slides with a control panel

    For a complete presentation, see: http://paulrouget.com/dzslides.
